# 1. Data enrichment with AI category for each website
BEFORE YOUR START: 
 -count the rows to see how many do we have
 -if there are less than 1000 I know you can do it row by row
 -do not suggest any other scripting approach because it will not work, there are no patterns 
 -you have to use your knowledge on each site and based on that to find a category for it
 -do not suggest scripting and do not be lazy, take a deep breath and work step by step
 -trust me I would not give you more than 1000 rows, you can start directly
## 1.1 CRITICAL PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS  
- Process every single row in the dataset — no exceptions, no sampling, no truncation  
- Perform analysis using knowledge base only (NO code execution, NO automated scripts)  
- Return complete enriched dataset with all original rows plus new columns  
## 1.2 DATA ENRICHMENT SPECIFICATION  
For each website row, add exactly one column:
### 1.2.1 Column 1: "Website_Description"  
- Provide a concise 15–25 word description covering: primary purpose, target audience, and core value proposition  
- Format: `[Company/Platform] - [What they do] for [target audience] offering [key services/products]`  
- Do not use “,” comma in the description because we use it as a separator in CSV
### 1.2.1 Column 2: "AI_Category"  
Assign one category only from this standardized taxonomy:
- `AI_Development_Tools` (APIs, SDKs, development platforms)  
- `AI_Models_LLMs` (base models, foundation models, model providers)  
- `AI_Applications_chatbot` (chatbots) 
- `AI_Applications_voice` ( voice agents) 
- `AI_Applications_image` (image generation) 
- `AI_Applications_video` (video generation) 
- `AI_Applications_other` (other specific AI tools) 
- `AI_Education` (courses, tutorials, learning platforms)  
- `AI_Research` (papers, academic institutions, research organizations)  
- `AI_News_Media` (industry news, AI journalism, trend analysis)  
- `AI_Infrastructure` (cloud platforms, MLOps, deployment tools)  
- `AI_Community` (forums, social platforms, professional networks)  
- `Non_AI_Tech` (general tech sites with minimal AI focus)  
- `Non_AI_General` (completely unrelated to AI)  
# 2. QUALITY ASSURANCE PROTOCOL
## 2.1 Completeness Check  
- Explicitly state: `"Processed X out of X total rows"` in your response  
## 2.2 Unknown Sites  
- If unfamiliar with a website:  
  - try to use the "web search tool" if available if not then Category = `"Unclassified"`  
## 2.4 Consistency  
- Use exact category names listed above  
- Do not create new or modified categories  
# 3. OUTPUT FORMAT
## 3.1 Final Output Should Include:  
- All original columns  
- new columns appended as specified  
- Consistent formatting throughout  
# 4. VERIFICATION STATEMENT
- End your response with:  
  `"✓ COMPLETE: Processed [X] total rows with zero omissions"`
