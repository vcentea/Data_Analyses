# TASK: Website Interaction Analysis & AI Ecosystem Visualization
## OBJECTIVE  
Analyze this CSV file that contains my browser history over the last 3 months, each site having a category attribute. Please identify key AI-related resources,
understand my research focus areas, my working tools and habits and visualize engagement patterns that reveal insights about my AI learning journey and professional
interests.
How to work:
 - Use all the data given.
 - First check programmatically all the existing categories to understand the content
 - Count programmatically the rows
 - After you know the possible categories, make a plan for the charts how to extract the data for them
 - Create the charts programmatically for all the data
### Analysis Charts  
- Top 15 most-visited AI sites (bar chart)  by: 
- total interactions 
- total days  
- Engagement intensity heatmap (interactions vs. distinct days) to identify deep-dive vs. casual browsing patterns  
- Site category distribution (pie/donut chart) showing AI subdomain focus areas   (by days)
- Engagement pattern analysis (high frequency + high day count = core resources)  
- Time investment distribution across AI categories  
- Discovery vs. reference pattern identification (low days/high interactions vs. high days/varied interactions)
-For the AI categories that are used a lot (top 5), list also the websites in the category in a separate chart
- Add any other chart if you find it useful or insightful given the data we have
### Site Classification & Categorization  
- Use existing site categorization but also create overarching categories for high level analyses
- Identify AI focus areas
## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS  
- Use modern, professional color schemes (avoid default chart colors)  
- Implement consistent typography and spacing  
- Include data labels and clear legends  
## INPUT DATA
Attached below browser history statistics
## OUTPUT FORMAT  
- Brief executive summary (2â€“3 sentences) of key findings  
- Individual chart sections with contextual analysis  
- Output directly everything in one shot do not ask me anything
